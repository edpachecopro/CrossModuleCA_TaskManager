# electron-osx-sign [![npm][npm_img]][npm_url] [![Build Status][travis_img]][travis_url]

Code-signing for packaged Electron OS X apps.

## About

[`electron-osx-sign`][electron-osx-sign] minimizes the extra work needed to eventually prepare your apps for shipping, providing the most basic tools and assets. Note that the bare necessities here are sufficient for enabling app sandbox, yet other configurations for like network access require additional work.

It is worth noting as well that starting from [Electron] v1.1.1, a new mechanism was introduced to satisfy IPC communications (see [electron#5601](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/5601)); wishing to have full support of various Electron versions, please utilize `opts.version`, which brings less hassle with making default settings among releases.

We are trying to keep updated to the Electron specifications; please [file us an issue](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/issues/new) if having any suggestions or experiencing difficulties code signing your products.

Please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/wiki) hosted here on GitHub for walk-throughs and notes from past projects shipped with [`electron-packager`][electron-packager] and [`electron-osx-sign`][electron-osx-sign].

*NB: The signing procedure implemented in this package is based on what described in [Mac App Store Submission Guide](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide.md).*

### An [OPEN Open Source Project](http://openopensource.org/)

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

### Collaborators

Thanks to [seanchas116](https://github.com/seanchas116), [jasonhinkle](https://github.com/jasonhinkle), and [develar](https://github.com/develar) for improving the usability of this project implementation.

## Installation

```sh
# For use in npm scripts
npm install --save electron-osx-sign
```

```sh
# For use from CLI
npm install -g electron-osx-sign
```

*Note: `electron-osx-sign` is a dependency of `electron-packager` as of 6.0.0 for signing apps on OS X. However, feel free to install this package globally for more customization beyond specifying identity and entitlements.*

## Usage

### electron-osx-sign

#### From the Command Line

```sh
electron-osx-sign <app> [additional-binaries...] [--options...]
```

Example:

```sh
electron-osx-sign path/to/my.app
```

The script above being sufficient, it is, however, recommended to make use of `opts.version` while signing for example:

```sh
electron-osx-sign path/to/my.app --version=1.2.0
```

For details on the optional flags, run `electron-osx-sign --help` or see [electron-osx-sign-usage.txt](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/blob/master/bin/electron-osx-sign-usage.txt).

#### From the API

```javascript
var sign = require('electron-osx-sign')
sign(opts[, function done (err) {}])
```

Example:

```javascript
var sign = require('electron-osx-sign')
sign({
  app: 'path/to/my.app'
}, function done (err) {
  if (err) {
    // Handle the error
    return;
  }
  // Application signed
})
```

From release v0.4.0-beta, [Bluebird] promises are introduced for better async method calls; the following is also available for use.

```javascript
var signAsync = require('electron-osx-sign').signAsync
signAsync(opts)
  [.then(function () {})
  [.catch(function (err) {})]]
```

Example:

```javascript
var signAsync = require('electron-osx-sign').signAsync
signAsync({
  app: 'path/to/my.app'
})
  .then(function () {
    // Application signed
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    // Handle the error
  })
```

###### opts - Options

**Required**

`app` - *String*

Path to the application package.
Needs file extension `.app`.

**Optional**

`binaries` - *Array*

Path to additional binaries that will be signed along with built-ins of Electron.
Default to `null`.

`entitlements` - *String*

Path to entitlements file for signing the app.
See [default.mas.entitlements](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/blob/master/default.mas.entitlements) or [default.darwin.entitlements](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/blob/master/default.darwin.entitlements) for default.

`entitlements-inherit` - *String*

Path to child entitlements which inherit the security settings for signing frameworks and bundles of a distribution. *This option only applies when signing with `entitlements` provided, or for a `mas` platform version.*
See [default.mas.inherit.entitlements](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/blob/master/default.mas.inherit.entitlements) or [default.darwin.inherit.entitlements](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/blob/master/default.darwin.inherit.entitlements) for default.

`identity` - *String*

Name of certificate to use when signing.
Default to retrieve from `keychain` (see below) or system default keychain.

Signing platform `mas` will look for `3rd Party Mac Developer Application: * (*)`, and platform `darwin` will look for `Developer ID Application: * (*)` by default.

`keychain` - *String*

The keychain name.
Default to system default keychain.

`ignore` - *String*

Regex or function that signals ignoring a file before signing.
Default to undefined.

`platform` - *String*

Build platform of Electron.
Allowed values: `darwin`, `mas`.
Default to auto detect by presence of `Squirrel.framework` within the application bundle.

`pre-auto-entitlements` - *Boolean*

Flag to enable automation of `com.apple.security.application-groups` in entitlements file and update `Info.plist` with `ElectronTeamID`.
Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
Default to `true`.

`version` - *String*

Build version of Electron.
Values may be like: `1.1.1`, `1.2.0`.
Default to latest Electron version.

It is recommended to utilize this option for best support of specific Electron versions. This may trigger pre/post operations for signing: For example, automation of setting `com.apple.security.application-groups` in entitlements file and of updating `Info.plist` with `ElectronTeamID` is enabled for all versions starting from `1.1.1`; set `pre-auto-entitlements` option to `false` to disable this feature.

###### cb - Callback

`err` - *Error*

### electron-osx-flat

#### From the Command Line

```sh
electron-osx-flat <app> [--options...]
```

Example:

```sh
electron-osx-flat path/to/my.app
```

For details on the optional flags, run `electron-osx-flat --help` or see [electron-osx-flat-usage.txt](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-osx-sign/blob/master/bin/electron-osx-flat-usage.txt).

#### From the API

```javascript
var flat = require('electron-osx-sign').flat
flat(opts[, function done (err) {}])
```

Example:

```javascript
var flat = require('electron-osx-sign').flat
flat({
  app: 'path/to/my.app'
}, function done (err) {
  if (err) {
    // Handle the error
    return;
  }
  // Application flattened
})
```

From release v0.4.0-beta, [Bluebird] promises are introduced for better async method calls; the following is also available for use.

```javascript
var flatAsync = require('electron-osx-sign').flatAsync
flatAsync(opts)
  [.then(function () {})
  [.catch(function (err) {})]]
```

Example:

```javascript
var flatAsync = require('electron-osx-sign').flatAsync
flatAsync({
  app: 'path/to/my.app'
})
  .then(function () {
    // Application flattened
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    // Handle the error
  })
```

###### opts - Options

**Required**

`app` - *String*

Path to the application bundle.
Needs file extension `.app`.

**Optional**

`identity` - *String*

Name of certificate to use when flattening.
Default to retrieve from `keychain`(see below) or system default keychain.

Flattening platform `mas` will look for `3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: * (*)`, and platform `darwin` will look for `Developer ID Installer: * (*)` by default.

`install` - *String*

Path to install for the bundle.
Default to `/Applications`.

`keychain` - *String*

The keychain name.
Default to system default keychain.

`platform` - *String*

Build platform of Electron. Allowed values: `darwin`, `mas`.

###### cb - Callback

`err` - *Error*

## Debug

As of release v0.3.1, external module `debug` is used to display logs and messages; remember to `export DEBUG=electron-osx-sign*` when necessary.

## Test

As developer certificates are required for `codesign` in OS X, this module may not be tested via online build services. If you wish to test out this module, enter:

```
npm test
```

from the dev directory, and tell us if all tests should pass.

When this command is fun for the first time: `electron-download` will download all major releases of Electron available for OS X from 0.24.0, and save to `~/.electron/`, which might take up less than 1GB of disk space.

A successful testing should look something like:

```
$ npm test

> electron-osx-sign@0.4.0-beta2 pretest electron-osx-sign
> rimraf test/work

> electron-osx-sign@0.4.0-beta2 test electron-osx-sign
> standard && tape test

Calling electron-download before running tests...
